## [2.0.0] — Unreleased

### Breaking changes

- **Reply-agent dispatch is now explicit, not implicit.** Previously, the
  renderer's watcher auto-fired a reply-agent dispatch on every new
  human-authored Annotation when `--reply-agent <name>` was set. Now,
  dispatch only happens when the user presses `s` on a focused human
  Annotation in the TUI, or clicks **Send to {agent}** on a human card
  in the webapp. The watcher's role narrows to state observation only
  (annotations.jsonl → bundle re-render; .reply-lock.json → in-flight
  pill + affordance disabled state). The new `POST /api/tours/:id/
  request-reply` endpoint maps the four dispatch result kinds to HTTP
  status codes (202 dispatched / 409 busy / 404 invalid-annotation /
  400 no-reply-agent). Reverses the auto-dispatch portion of ADR 0010;
  see ADR 0021 for rationale (paid-LLM-inference economics — every
  silent over-dispatch under the old model was real money).

- **Bare `tour` picks the best surface for your environment.** Previously,
  `tour` (no subcommand) always launched the TUI. It now starts the
  webapp and prints its URL when a browser is reachable (desktop
  linux/darwin with a TTY, `open` or `xdg-open` on PATH, no SSH session)
  and falls back to the TUI otherwise (ssh, piped/non-TTY stdout,
  windows, no opener). The URL is Cmd/Ctrl-clickable in modern
  terminals — bare `tour` does **not** auto-open the browser, so
  re-running the command does not stack tabs. Users who want the
  browser launched automatically run `tour serve --open` explicitly,
  which is unchanged. `tour tui` is also unchanged. The first-run
  banner (no tours present) still prints unchanged.

  The deciding criterion is annotation fidelity: the webapp renders
  markdown + mermaid, the TUI shows raw source. New users on a desktop
  now get the higher-fidelity surface by default.

### Added

- **Core seam for explicit reply-agent dispatch.** Two new pure entry
  points land in `core/` ahead of the dispatch-trigger flip (PRD #181):
  `requestReply(opts)` in `core/reply-runner.ts` is the single dispatch
  entry point both surfaces will converge on — it validates the
  annotation (must exist, be human-authored, and not yet have a Reply),
  atomically acquires `.reply-lock.json`, spawns the configured agent,
  captures stdout as the Reply Annotation, and releases the lock,
  returning a discriminated `{ kind: "dispatched" | "busy" |
  "invalid-annotation" | "no-reply-agent" }`. `canSendToAgent(...)` in
  `core/can-send-to-agent.ts` is the pure predicate consumed by both
  surfaces to decide visibility/enabled state of the per-card
  affordance. No surface or watcher wiring is changed in this slice —
  the watcher-driven auto-dispatch still works exactly as today. (#182)
- `tour serve` prints a one-line tip when exactly one shipped agent CLI
  (`claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `opencode`, `pi`) is reachable on PATH
  and `--reply-agent` is not passed, suggesting the flag. Zero or
  multiple matches stay silent. The tip is informational only — the
  reply watcher remains inert unless `--reply-agent` is explicitly
  given (ADR 0010 inert-by-default invariant). (#176)

### Changed

- **`tour serve` reuses a running server when one already exists for the
  same working directory.** Before binding, the entry point probes the
  preferred port (`GET /__alive`) and, if it finds a Tour server whose
  `cwd` matches, prints `Tour already running at http://127.0.0.1:<port>`
  and exits 0 — no second server is started. Different-cwd Tour or
  non-Tour processes on the port behave as before (fall back to the
  next port, or surface `port N is in use` when `--port` was explicit).
  Stable URLs across re-runs; no process / watcher proliferation. (#178)
- **`tour serve <id>` prints a deep URL.** When a positional tour-id is
  passed, the startup line now includes `/<id>` as a path component
  (e.g. `Tour server running at http://127.0.0.1:8687/<id>`) so the
  user can Cmd-click straight to that tour in a modern terminal.
  `tour serve` without a tour-id is unchanged (bare base URL). The
  port-collision fallback path also includes `/<id>` and reflects the
  actually-bound port. `--open` opens the deep URL too. (#179)
- **SPA reads tour-id from the URL path and annotation-id from the URL
  fragment.** Precedence is path → query → baked global for tour-id,
  fragment → query for annotation-id. Loading `/<tour-id>` always
  displays that tour regardless of what id the server's HTML carries —
  the probe-reuse case (Issue #178) no longer mis-routes the printed
  deep URL. Loading `/<tour-id>#<ann-id>` scrolls to the named
  annotation. Internal navigation (tour-picker, n/p cursor) now writes
  the new path + fragment shape; legacy `?tour=&ann=` URLs remain
  readable as a back-compat fallback. (#179)
- **TUI footer hint labels the `a` action as `comment`** (was
  `annotate`), aligning Tour's vocabulary with the universal
  convention used by every collaborative code-review tool. The webapp
  composer's affordance already read "Comment" / "Leave a comment".
  The `a` keybinding, the `tour annotate` CLI verb, the "Annotation"
  domain noun, the schema, and the Pierre `AnnotationSide` coupling
  are all unchanged. (#183)

### Fixed

- **Bare `tour serve` prints the auto-picked tour-id in the URL.**
  Previously, `tour serve` with no positional id printed
  `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` — a bare base URL. The SPA then auto-picked
  a tour client-side, but the terminal-printed URL was never refreshed,
  so a user copying the URL out of the terminal shared an ambiguous
  link. The server now pre-picks the same tour the SPA would
  auto-select — the most-recent **open** tour — and bakes that id into
  both `__INITIAL_TOUR_ID__` and the printed URL
  (`http://127.0.0.1:<port>/<id>`). Explicit `tour serve <id>` is
  unchanged. Zero open tours → bare URL, unchanged. The pick rule is
  extracted to a shared `pickAutoTour` helper consumed by both
  surfaces so the server's pre-pick and the SPA's auto-pick agree by
  construction, not by accident. (#187)

- **Address bar updates when the SPA is entered at bare `/`.** The
  URL-writer effect's "URL contradicts state" gate previously read the
  URL with a `null` fallback, so a bare `/` resolved to `null` and the
  writer treated it as a contradiction with the auto-selected tour-id
  in state — skipping the write on every cursor move and freezing the
  address bar at `/`. The gate now uses the state's tour-id as the
  fallback: a bare URL is no contradiction (the writer migrates `/`
  to `/<tour-id>#<ann-id>` on first cursor anchor), while a URL that
  asserts a *different* tour-id (the in-flight tour-switch window)
  still skips. (#180)
