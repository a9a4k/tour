## [2.0.0] — Unreleased

### Added

- `tour serve` prints a one-line tip when exactly one shipped agent CLI
  (`claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `opencode`, `pi`) is reachable on PATH
  and `--reply-agent` is not passed, suggesting the flag. Zero or
  multiple matches stay silent. The tip is informational only — the
  reply watcher remains inert unless `--reply-agent` is explicitly
  given (ADR 0010 inert-by-default invariant). (#176)
