## [2.0.0] — Unreleased

### Breaking changes

- **Bare `tour` picks the best surface for your environment.** Previously,
  `tour` (no subcommand) always launched the TUI. It now starts the
  webapp and prints its URL when a browser is reachable (desktop
  linux/darwin with a TTY, `open` or `xdg-open` on PATH, no SSH session)
  and falls back to the TUI otherwise (ssh, piped/non-TTY stdout,
  windows, no opener). The URL is Cmd/Ctrl-clickable in modern
  terminals — bare `tour` does **not** auto-open the browser, so
  re-running the command does not stack tabs. Users who want the
  browser launched automatically run `tour serve --open` explicitly,
  which is unchanged. `tour tui` is also unchanged. The first-run
  banner (no tours present) still prints unchanged.

  The deciding criterion is annotation fidelity: the webapp renders
  markdown + mermaid, the TUI shows raw source. New users on a desktop
  now get the higher-fidelity surface by default.

  Issue: #175 · PRD: #174

### Added

- `tour serve` prints a one-line tip when exactly one shipped agent CLI
  (`claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `opencode`, `pi`) is reachable on PATH
  and `--reply-agent` is not passed, suggesting the flag. Zero or
  multiple matches stay silent. The tip is informational only — the
  reply watcher remains inert unless `--reply-agent` is explicitly
  given (ADR 0010 inert-by-default invariant). (#176)

### Changed

- **`tour serve` reuses a running server when one already exists for the
  same working directory.** Before binding, the entry point probes the
  preferred port (`GET /__alive`) and, if it finds a Tour server whose
  `cwd` matches, prints `Tour already running at http://127.0.0.1:<port>`
  and exits 0 — no second server is started. Different-cwd Tour or
  non-Tour processes on the port behave as before (fall back to the
  next port, or surface `port N is in use` when `--port` was explicit).
  Stable URLs across re-runs; no process / watcher proliferation. (#178)
